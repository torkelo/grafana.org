You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.</p><p>For some background on why contributor license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other open source projects:</p><ul><li><a target="blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/faq/">Django's excellent CLA FAQ</a></li><li><a target="blank" href="http://producingoss.com/en/copyright-assignment.html">A well-written chapter from Karl Fogel's Producing Open Source Software on CLAs</a></li><li><a target="blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_license_agreement">The Wikipedia article on CLAs</a></li></ul><p>This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense the code with a more permissive license in the future.</p><p>If you have more questions, shoot us an email or drop by #influxdb on IRC.</p><p><i>Many thanks to <a target="blank" href="http://rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a> for permission to re-use their CLA!</i></p><hr /><h2>Terms of the Agreement</h2><p>This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Errplane, Inc. dba InfluxDB, a Delaware corporation (“InfluxDB,” “we” or “us” etc.) and you (as defined and further identified below).

This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California in the United States without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.</p><iframe frameborder="0" height="820" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cii_G2M-c1h-MSY1qyGOFoo5EZjZGuUK4B9fMUSF8o4/viewform?embedded=true" width="800">Loading CLA...</iframe></div></div></section><div id="blueimp-gallery" class="blueimp-gallery blueimp-gallery-controls"><div class="slides"></div><h3 class="title"></h3><a class="prev">‹</a><a class="next">›</a><a class="close">×</a><a class="play-pause"></a><ol class="indicator"></ol></div><footer class="page-footer"><div class="footer-bg"></div><section class="newsletter"><div class="row"><h1 class="text-center">Get notified of new releases</h1></div><div class="row"><div class="medium-10 large-6 columns medium-offset-1 large-offset-3"><form action="http://grafana.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2aeb5711db2aececc990be536&amp;id=5585d37ecc" class="validate" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank"><div class="row collapse"><div class="medium-10 columns"><input class="email" id="mce-EMAIL" name="EMAIL" placeholder="email address" type="email" value="" /></div><div class="medium-2 columns"><input class="button postfix" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" name="subscribe" type="submit" value="Subscribe" /></div></div></form></div></div></section><div class="footer-content row text-center"><ul class="footer-social"><li><i class="fa fa-github"></i><a href="https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues">issue tracker</a> on GitHub</li><li><i class="fa fa-comment"></i><a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#grafana">#grafana</a> on freenode</li><li><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i><a href="http://twitter.com/grafana">@grafana</a> on Twitter</li><li><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i><a href="mailto:torkel@grafana.org">email</a></li></ul><div class="row copyright text-center">&copy; 2015 Torkel Ödegaard &amp; Coding Instinct AB<iframe allowtransparency="true" class="github-btn" frameborder="false" height="20" scrolling="0" src="http://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=grafana&amp;repo=grafana&amp;type=watch&amp;count=true" title="Star on GitHub" width="100"></iframe><iframe allowtransparency="true" class="github-btn" frameborder="false" height="20" scrolling="0" src="http://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=grafana&amp;repo=grafana&amp;type=fork&amp;count=true" title="Fork on GitHub" width="80"></iframe></div></div></footer><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
